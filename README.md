TOP - JS Restaurant Page

This project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/restaurant-page]

For this project I created a mock restaurant website using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

-- webpack
-- html
-- css
-- javascript
-- modules

I created a barebones html template for my website and populated it's contents with Javascript DOM manipulation. 

I created modules for each tab and added tab browsing to call different tab modules so that each indivfidual page could be loaded using only Javascript.

The final page can be viewed here [https://rueeazy.github.io/restaurant-page/]
